# Unsupervised Learning Metrics

Implementation of metrics for unsupervised learning. Currently implemented are

- **Area under Mass-Volume curve** (Stephan Clémençon and Jeremie Jakubowicz, Scoring anomalies: a M-estimation formulation approach. 2013-04)
- **Area under Mass-Volume curve for high dimensional spaces** (https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.01152)
